# go-webget

A little like that wget thing, only much simpler and absolutely toothless in comparsion. But it downloads files from the internet and saves them to your harddisk or loads the content into memory.

That's basically it.

Have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/grumpypixel/go-webget/tree/main/examples) if you need to know more.
